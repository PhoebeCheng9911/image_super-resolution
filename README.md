## Image Super-resolution Performance
The project aims to compare the performance of two popular image super-resolution techniques and evaluate their ability to improve the quality of low-resolution images using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
 
We implemented all our models on TensorFlow2.0 platform. Python is the major language used, and all codes are developed in Jupyter notebooks. In addition, we used PIL.Image module, mainly for results visulization.

For training our model, we used Div2K dataset, which contains 1,000 2K high resolution images of diverse subjects, split by 800-100-100 into train-val-test datasets.
